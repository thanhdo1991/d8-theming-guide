Stark is one of the themes bundled with Drupal 8. It is intentionally barebones and its purpose is to help Drupal theme and module developers get to the heart of Drupal's system templates.

## Goal

Recognize Stark theme and identify its primary features. Explain the use cases for Stark and what you can learn from it.

## Why explore Stark?

* Examine the default markup and behavior provided by the Drupal system.
* Troubleshoot Drupal core behavior and output.
* Troubleshoot and isolate problems from other modules or themes.

According to Stark's _README.txt _, Stark is provided for demonstration purposes.

Stark:

* Drupal's default markup
* No styling through CSS

Use browser tools to inspect elements or view source to see which of Drupal's system templates are in use for various elements.

Stark does include a few files that are there but don't actually do anything, except to show you that you could use them.

Stark's _css/layout.css_ exists, but is now blank

Stark no longer removes _normalize.css _, a file is added by core.
