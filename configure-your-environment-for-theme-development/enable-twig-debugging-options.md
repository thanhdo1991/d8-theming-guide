Enabling Twig debugging involves locating the`twig.config[debug]`settings in your\_services.yml\_file and changing their values.

These variables can be edited either directly in _sites/default/services.yml_, or alternately they can be added to the\_sites/development.services.yml\_file if you followed the steps above to use a _settings.local.php_ file.
