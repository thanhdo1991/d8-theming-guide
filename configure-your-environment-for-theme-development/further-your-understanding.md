Why should you use a settings.local.php file instead of just editing settings.php directly?

* Environment-specific settings for local

* Avoid push settings.php file to live environment \(local and live have both settings.php file\).

In which file do I change the settings that enables the Twig engines debugging output?

_services.yml or development.services.yml if use _settings.local.php file

Enable theme debugging for your own development environment and poke around a bit. What changed?
