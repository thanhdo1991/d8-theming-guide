Enabling Twig debugging involves locating the`twig.config[debug]`settings in your_services.yml_file and changing their values.

These variables can be edited either directly in_sites/default/services.yml_, or alternately they can be added to the_sites/development.services.yml_file if you followed the steps above to use a_settings.local.php_file.
