Before you take a screenshot, you should set up a demo page with important features displayed so that you and others can see a preview of how the theme will look when it's set as the default theme.

* Login as a user with the administrator role.
* Configure your theme's settings to display the features it supports.
* Change sitename, slogan, upload a default user profile picture and create some articles
