In addition to looking through the theme's chain of inheritance for a template file, Drupal will also look for templates that match a predefined naming convention for a best-fit match. These potential alternate names are referred to as theme hook suggestions.\n\nnode--{NODE.NID}.html.twig -- node-123.html.twig\nnode--{NODE.TYPE}.html.twig -- node--blog_post.html.twig\nnode.html.twig\n\nExample 1: Displayingnode/123, node type: \"blog_post\".\n\n[] themes/icecream/templates/node--42.html.twig (Not a match; wrong node ID)\n[x] themes/icecream/templates/node--blog_post.html.twig (Match: node type; template used)\n[ ] themes/icecream/templates/node.html.twig\n\nExample 2: Displayingnode/21, node type: \"page\".\n\n[ ] themes/icecream/templates/node--42.html.twig (Not a match; wrong node ID)\n[ ] themes/icecream/templates/node--blog_post.html.twig (Not a match: wrong node type) \n[x] themes/icecream/templates/node.html.twig (Match: all nodes; template used)\n\nExample Twig debug output:\n\nSuggestions added by hooks\nTheme hook suggestions are provided by one of three hooks.

Preprocess functions are optional, and are defined in a theme's THEMENAME.theme file.\nPreprocess functions are called once for each time a template is used.\nPreprocess functions follow a specific naming convention: THEMENAME_preprocess_HOOK()\nEach preprocess function receives a single argument, usually named $variables, that is an associative array. The array is passed by reference so that you can manipulate the data it contains. The keys of this array directly correspond with the names of the variables in the preprocess function's corresponding template file.\n\nFor example, your THEMENAME.theme file might include a preprocess function like the following which acts on variables for the node.html.twig template file:\n\nIn addition to the template-specific preprocess functions, there is also a single THEMENAME_preprocess ()function that is called for every template file.This function receives a second argument which is the hook or template name. This can be used for scenarios where you want to perform data processing for every single template file.\nModules can also implement preprocess functions, and frequently do so in order to define the default set of variables available in a template file. The complete list of preprocess functions called for a template file is below, listed in the order they are called (if they exist):\n\ntemplate_preprocess(&$variables,$hook): Creates a default set of variables for all theme hooks with template implementations. Provided by Drupal Core. https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21theme.inc/function/template_preprocess/8.3.x\ntemplate_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): Should be implemented by the module that registers the theme hook, to set up default variables. https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21form.inc/function/template_preprocess_select/8.3.x\nMODULE_preprocess(&$variables,$hook): hook_preprocess() is invoked on all implementing modules.\nhttps://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21system%21tests%21modules%21common_test%21common_test.module/function/common_test_preprocess/8.3.x\nMODULE_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): hook_preprocess_HOOK() is invoked on all implementing modules, so that modules that didn't define the theme hook can alter the variables. https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21node%21node.module/function/node_preprocess_html/8.3.x\nENGINE_engine_preprocess(&$variables,$hook): Allows the theme engine to set necessary variables for all theme hooks with template implementations.\nENGINE_engine_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): Allows the theme engine to set necessary variables for the particular theme hook.\nTHEME_preprocess(&$variables,$hook): Allows the theme to set necessary variables for all theme hooks with template implementations.\nTHEME_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): Allows the theme to set necessary variables specific to the particular theme hook. https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21themes%21bartik%21bartik.theme/function/bartik_preprocess_html/8.3.x\n\nTips and tricks\nPreprocess functions should always return render arrays. Twig will render arrays to HTML automatically when they are printed. And there is no need to call theme()ordrupal_render()inside a preprocess function. This allows for more customization within the Twig template file, and is more performant because you don't end up rendering an array that is never displayed on the page.\n\n"},"change-variables-with-preprocess-functions.html":{"url":"change-variables-with-preprocess-functions.html","title":"Change Variables with Preprocess Functions","keywords":"","body":"Preprocess functions are specially named functions that allow themes and modules to perform additional manipulation of variables used in a Twig template file.\nChanging existing variables\n\nCreate a .theme file\nDetermine the hook name\nAdd a preprocess function\nFind the variable you want to change\nThe $variablesargument passed to this new function is an associative array.
