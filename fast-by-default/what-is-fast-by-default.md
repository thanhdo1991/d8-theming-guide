In previous versions of Drupal \(drupal 6,7\),  some features \(page caching and CSS aggregation\) were turned off on a new Drupal installation and required an administrator to enable them.

With Drupal 8 these performance-enhancing features are enabled by default, which encourages best practices, and helps to ensure that more Drupal sites take advantage of them.
