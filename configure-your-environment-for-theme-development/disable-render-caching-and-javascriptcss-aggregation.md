In addition, aggregation can be turned off in the UI by navigating to _Configuration_&gt;_Performance _\(admin/config/development/performance\).

When setting up a development environment, change these settings directly in your _settings.php_ file. \(This is the preferred method.\) The best way to do this is to enable the use of a _settings.local.php_ file.
