The decision to use Stable or Classy as the base theme:

* Stable: pristine, clean, semantic markup
* Classy: a collection of reasonably verbose defaults

If we take a look at the Stark theme directory \(_/core/themes/stark_\) we can see that there are no template files at all.

If we compare that to the Stable theme \(_/core/themes/stable_\) we see that it ships with several templates. \(In fact Stable includes every template available to Drupal core.\)
