When selecting a theme from _Appearance &gt;  Settings_, you will find the global settings that you can override as well as custom settings added by the theme that apply only to this particular theme.

All of the global settings can be overridden in a specific theme's settings.

Any future changes in global settings will no longer apply to a theme where settings have been changed.
