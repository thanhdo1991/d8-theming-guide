Preprocess functions allow Drupal themes to manipulate the variables that are used in Twig template files by using PHP functions to _preprocess _data before it is exposed to each template. All of the dynamic content available to theme developers within a Twig template file is exposed through a preprocess function. Understanding how preprocess functions work, and the role they play, is important for both module developers and theme developers.
